# Predicting_Hospital_Expanses

In order for a health insurance company to make money, it needs to collect more
annual premiums of what you spend on medical care for your beneficiaries. As a result,
insurers invest a great deal of time and money in the development of
models that can accurately predict medical expenses for the insured population. At
medical expenses are difficult to estimate, because the most expensive treatments are rare and
seem to occur in a seemingly random manner. Still, some conditions are more
common in certain segments of the population. For example, lung cancer is more likely
among smokers than non-smokers and heart disease may be more likely among
obese. The purpose of this analysis is to use patient data to estimate average expenses
medical assistance to these segments of the population. These estimates can be used
to create tables that set prices for higher or lower annual premiums,
depending on the expected treatment costs.
To solve this problem and create a prediction model, we will use linear regression, because
treat data with quantitative variables.
We will use the expenses.csv dataset, available in our repository.
